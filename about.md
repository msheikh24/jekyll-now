I always wanted to start my own blog but due to laziness and work it never happened.  The purpose of this blog will be to try different algorithms and publish my finding here.  

### More Information

Computers have evolved over the years, from my first Intel 486 computer to now technology has changed tremendously.  My focus over the years was always been programing languages.  I have written programs in Basic, C, Java, Python, and R (somewhat).  The focus is now on using tools to analyze data using Python, R, or SAS.  I am brushing up my skills for R & SAS and hopefully will be done by the end of summer.
